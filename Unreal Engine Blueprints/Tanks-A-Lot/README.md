<b>plot the game </b>
<p>Tanks-A-Lot is a party game in which the players control small cartoon-style tanks in various gamemodes including Capture the Flag, Deathmatch, and others.
This project was completed over a small two week prototyping period and then a seven week stretch for finalisation.</p>

<b>My contribution </b>

In this project I acted as a senior developer so in addition to developing major aspects of the project I also had a group of 3 junior developers whom I was responsible for mentoring.

<ul>
  <li>Investigate the feasibility of having lan multiplayer</li>
  <li>Rebuilding the tank controls/handling based off player feedback </li>
  <li>Level design where needed</li>
  <li>Managing and assigning tasks to a sub team of 3 junior developers</li>
</ul>
