<b>plot the game </b>
<p>A study in secrecy is a procedurally generated sci-fi puzzle game, where the player acts as a hacker trying to break in to the servers of 1 of 3 mega-corporations and steal the data found within. Dispite having one accademic 
year to develop this project, it did suffer from a cronic lack of an animator forcing us to cut corners</p>

<b>My contribution </b>

<p> Officially my role on this project was 'Junior developer', in terms of development team there was 2 developers (me and a senior) and 8 artists.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developed the procedural generation system that underpins the entire game as my entire </li>
  <li>Occasional puzzle room design</li>
  <li>A number of QOL things that got cut such as post level generation cut scene systems</li>
  <li>Implimented a bunch of the in game flavour text from prompts provided by the lead developer</li>
</ul>
