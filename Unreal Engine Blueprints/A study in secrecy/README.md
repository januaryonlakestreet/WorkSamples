<b>plot the game </b>
<p>A study in secrecy is a procedurally generated sci-fi puzzle game, where the player acts as a hacker trying to break in to the servers of 1 of 3 mega-corporations and steal the data found within. Dispite having one accademic 
year to develop this project, it did suffer from a cronic lack of an animator forcing us to cut corners</p>

<b>My contribution </b>
<p>Officially my role in this project was a junior tech however I was given the procedural generation system that underpins the entire game as my entire "+
"A bulk of my time was spent developing the procedural generation aspect of this project developing "+
"it so that the player had a path through different puzzle rooms with no backtracking needed and sufficient configurability as to let each mega-corporation feel different."+
"Towards the end of development I was asked to work on a number of design aspects that got cut for example I developed a post level generation cut scene tool that would give the player a better overview of the generated route."+
"Additionally I was responsible for designing a number of puzzle rooms.</p>
